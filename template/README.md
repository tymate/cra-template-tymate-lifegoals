# Build-your-own-life-goals workshop

## Instructions

1. [Create your own GitHub repo](https://github.com/new). Make it public, and initialize without `README`, `.gitignore` or `licence` file.
2. Try getting your fake API by going to [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/my-username/my-repo](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/my-username/my-repo) where `my-username/my-repo` represents the GitHub URI of you repo.
3. Your `App.js` file is ready to be read, your mission is explained there, or below.

## Launching the app

```
yarn dev
```

This command will launch the React App as well as the API on port 3001.

## Deploying

### 1. Add `homepage` to `package.json`

```
"homepage": "https://my-username.github.io/my-repo",
```

```
yarn deploy
```

## The mission:

We would like you to create your own **life goals app**. You will be able to get access to a fake API, located at https://my-json-server.typicode.com/my-username/my-repo/goals.

The app should consist of three pages:

- A homepage, `/`, containing the list of you life goals.
- A goal details page, `/:goalId`, displaying your life goals in more details. What changes between the homepage and the details page is up to you, but we suggest thinking about truncating or hiding the goals description on the homepage.
- An admin page, `/admin`, where you will be able to create, update and delete you life goals. We would like the `title`, `description` and `imageUrl` (consider using Unsplash?) to be mandatory. We would like the `completion` field to act as checkbox as well as date reference.
